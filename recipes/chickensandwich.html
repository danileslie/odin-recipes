    <h3 class="steps-title">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450˚F. Wash and dry all produce. Remove butter from fridge to soften. 
                Start the recipe when the oven is ready. Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch wedges. To a parchment-lined 
                baking sheet, add potatoes and 1 tbsp oil. Season with salt, then toss to coat. Arrange in a single 
                layer. (NOTE: For 4 portions, use 2 baking sheets, with 1 tbsp oil per sheet. Roast on the lower 
                and middle racks of the oven, switching baking sheet positions halfway through.) Roast on the lower
                 rack of the oven for 25-35 min, flipping halfway through, until golden-brown and crispy.</li>
                 
            <li>Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Season with salt, pepper and BBQ Spice Blend.
                 To another parchment-lined baking sheet, add chicken. Roast on the upper rack of the oven for 
                 12-14 min, until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine mayo and mustard. (NOTE: This is your mustard mayo.) In 
                a large bowl, whisk together half the vinegar (use all for 4 portions), 1 tbsp mustardy mayo 
                and 1/2 tsp sugar (double both for 4 portions). Add cabbage to the large bowl, season with salt
                 and pepper, then toss to coat. Set aside.</li>
            <li>When chicken is out of the oven, halve buns. Directly to the top rack of the oven, add buns,
                 cut-side up. Toast for 2-4 min, until golden. (TIP: Keep your eye on them so they don't burn!)
                  Spread 2 tsp butter (double for 4 portions) over toasted buns. Once chicken is cool enough
                   to handle, thinly slice.</li>
            <li>Stack chicken and slaw on bottom buns. Close with top buns. Plate sandwiches with wedges 
                and remaining mustardy mayo alongside for dipping. Enjoy!</li>
