            <li>2 medium onions</li>
            <li>1 pound very thinly sliced beef</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup dashi stock (can also substitute beef or chicken stock)</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked white rice (short grain or medium grain preferred)</li>
            <li>1 scallion (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook the sliced onions for about 10 minutes, stirring often.</li>
            <li>Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned. Add the mirin, soy sauce, and stock. Bring to a simmer, and 
                cook for about 10-15 minutes to reduce the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat another couple tablespoons of oil in a cast iron or non-stick skillet. Cook the eggs sunny-side up. You can cook 
                them in batches if needed. The yolks should still be runny!</li>
            <li>When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among 4 bowls, and top with the beef and an egg for each bowl. Garnish with 
                chopped scallion and toasted sesame seeds, if using.</li>
        </ol>
