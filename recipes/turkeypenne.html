    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This delicious, no-fuss pasta dish will satisfy even the pickiest eater! We've packed it with Tex-Mex spices, a cheesy, tangy 
            sour cream sauce and crunchy tortilla chips – and snuck in a few veggies, for good measure.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>    
        <ul>
            <li>250 g ground turkey</li>
            <li>2 tbsp enchilada spice blend</li>
            <li>370 mL crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>85 g tortilla chips</li>
            <li>1 unit green onion</li>
            <li>170 g penne</li>
            <li>½ cup tomato salsa</li>
            <li>200 g green bell pepper</li>
            <li>3 tbsp sour cream</li>
            <li>½ cup monterey jack cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>¼ tsp Salt</li>
            <li>0.13 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>½ tsp sugar</li>  
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Before starting, preheat the broiler to high. Add 10 cups water and 2 tsp salt to a large pot (use same for 4 ppl). 
                Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Wash and dry all produce. Add penne to the boiling water. Cook uncovered, 
                stirring occasionally, until tender, 10-12 min. Reserve 1/4 cup pasta water (dbl for 4 ppl), then drain and return 
                penne to the same pot, off heat.</li>
            <li>While penne cooks, heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. While the pan heats, core, then cut pepper into 
                1/2-inch pieces. When hot, add 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then turkey. Cook, breaking up turkey into smaller pieces,
                until no pink remains, 4-5 min.** Add peppers, then sprinkle with Enchilada Spice Blend. Season with salt and pepper.
                Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 30 sec.</li>
            <li>Add crushed tomatoes, salsa and 1/2 tsp sugar (dbl for 4 ppl) to the pan with turkey and peppers. Season with salt 
                and pepper, then stir to combine. Bring to a simmer over high. Once simmering, reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring 
                occasionally, until peppers are tender-crisp, 4-5 min.</li>
            <li>While sauce cooks, thinly slice green onion. Open one side of the package of tortilla chips. Gently crush tortilla 
                chips in their package until broken into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>Add half the cheese, turkey, sauce and reserved pasta water to the pot with penne. Heat the pot over medium. Stir 
                until cheese melts and sauce thickens slightly, 2-3 min. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer penne mixture
                 to an 8x8-inch baking dish (9x13-inch for 4 ppl). Sprinkle with crushed tortilla chips and remaining cheese. Broil 
                 in the middle of the oven until cheese melts, 2-3 min. (TIP: Keep an eye on chips so they don't burn!)</li>
            <li>Divide penne between plates. Dollop with sour cream. Sprinkle green onions over top.</li>
